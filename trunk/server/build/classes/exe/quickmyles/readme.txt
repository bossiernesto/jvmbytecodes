Note:

This compiles but isn't yet producing anything worthwhile.

However, I've committed it for the sake of future work on it.

It was supposed to use a Structure called recursive_tree, but that was
producing tons of errors when GAIGS tried to load it, so I replaced
all references to "recursive_tree" with "Bar".
